# ðŸš— FINN Car Subscription Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview

Hey there! Welcome to what I consider one of my most comprehensive data analytics projects yet. This is not just another dashboard it is a full-blown business intelligence platform specifically designed for car subscription services like FINN.

After spending a lot of time and effort analyzing how subscription-based car rental companies operate, I realized there was a enormous gap in specialized analytics tools for this industry. Most companies were stuck using generic dashboards that could not capture the unique challenges of managing fleets, predicting customer churn, and optimizing subscription pricing.

That is where this project comes in. I have built everything from scratch using Python and Streamlit, creating a professional-grade analytics platform that any car subscription business could deploy tomorrow.

## What Makes This Special and different?

Contrast typical data dashboards that just show pretty charts, this system actually *thinks*. I have integrated machine learning models that can predict which customers are likely to cancel their subscriptions and forecast demand patterns across different cities and vehicle types.

The whole thing runs on realistic sample data that mimics real business scenarios. I spent considerable time crafting data that reflects actual customer segments you'd find in the German car subscription market - from tech-savvy urban professionals in Munich to corporate fleet managers in Frankfurt.

## Core Features Breakdown

### Executive Dashboard - The 30,000 Foot View
This is where C-suite executives get their daily dose of business reality. I've designed it to answer the most critical questions within seconds:
- How many active customers do we have right now?
- What's our monthly recurring revenue looking like?
- Are we bleeding customers faster than we're acquiring them?
- Which cities are performing best?

The KPI cards update in real-time, and I've added color-coding that makes good news green and concerning trends red. No more squinting at spreadsheets during board meetings.

### Customer Analytics - Know Your People
This section dives deep into customer behavior patterns. I'm particularly proud of the churn risk analysis here. The system automatically identifies customers who show warning signs - maybe they've contacted support multiple times, or their app usage has dropped significantly.

The satisfaction correlation chart was inspired by my own frustrations with subscription services. I wanted to understand what actually makes customers happy versus what companies *think* makes them happy.

### Demand Forecasting - Crystal Ball for Business
Predicting demand in the car subscription business is incredibly complex. You've got seasonal variations (nobody wants a convertible in December), geographic preferences (urban vs suburban needs), and economic factors all playing together.

I've built models that consider all these variables. The system can tell you whether you need more electric vehicles in Berlin next month or if your premium sedan inventory in Stuttgart is about to run short.

### Machine Learning Insights - The Smart Stuff
This is where the magic happens. I've implemented two core ML models:

**Churn Prediction Model**: Uses Random Forest algorithms to analyze 15+ customer variables and predict who's likely to cancel. The model considers everything from payment history to app engagement scores.

**Demand Forecasting Model**: Predicts subscription demand based on historical patterns, seasonal trends, and external factors. It's saved me from countless "we're out of cars" scenarios in my simulations.

The feature importance charts show exactly which factors matter most for customer retention. Spoiler alert: it's not always what you'd expect.

### Strategic Insights - Actionable Intelligence
Raw data is useless without context. This section translates all the analytics into concrete business recommendations. I've prioritized them by impact and urgency, so you know exactly what to tackle first.

The risk assessment section is particularly valuable - it quantifies exactly how much revenue is at risk from potential churns and suggests specific mitigation strategies.

## Technical Architecture Deep Dive

### Data Generation Philosophy
Instead of using boring, unrealistic dummy data, I've created a sophisticated data generation system that produces believable business scenarios. The customer data reflects real demographic patterns in German cities, with segment-specific behaviors that mirror actual market research.

For example, Corporate Fleet customers have lower churn rates but higher average subscription values, while Urban Professionals show more price sensitivity but higher app engagement. These aren't random patterns - they're based on actual industry insights.

### Machine Learning Implementation
The churn prediction model uses Random Forest because it handles mixed data types well and provides interpretable results. I've engineered features that capture complex customer behaviors:

```python
# Feature engineering examples from the code
model_data['monthly_per_satisfaction'] = model_data['monthly_subscription'] * model_data['satisfaction_score']
model_data['high_value_customer'] = (model_data['lifetime_value'] > model_data['lifetime_value'].quantile(0.8)).astype(int)
model_data['service_heavy_user'] = (model_data['support_contacts'] > 2).astype(int)
```

These derived features often predict churn better than raw variables alone.

### Visualization Strategy
I chose Plotly over matplotlib because interactivity matters in business dashboards. Executives want to hover over data points, zoom into specific time periods, and explore data dynamically. Static charts feel outdated in 2024.

Each chart tells a specific story:
- Line charts for trends over time
- Bar charts for comparisons between categories  
- Pie charts for composition analysis
- Scatter plots for correlation exploration

## Code Structure Explanation

### Main Application Flow
The application follows a clean object-oriented design:

```python
class FINNAnalyticsDashboard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.customer_data = None
        self.demand_data = None
        self.churn_model = None
        self.demand_model = None
```

This structure keeps data and models organized while allowing for easy expansion.

### Data Loading Process
The `load_sample_data()` method creates two main datasets:
1. **Customer data**: Individual customer records with demographics, behavior metrics, and churn indicators
2. **Demand data**: Time-series data showing daily subscription patterns across cities and vehicle types

### Model Training Pipeline
Both ML models follow similar patterns:
1. Feature engineering and encoding
2. Train/test splitting
3. Model training with Random Forest
4. Performance evaluation
5. Storage for later prediction use

### UI Component Architecture
Each dashboard tab is self-contained, making the code maintainable and allowing for easy feature additions. The sidebar controls provide a centralized way to manage data loading and model training.

## Installation and Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
You'll need Python 3.7 or higher. I've tested this extensively on Python 3.9 and 3.10, but it should work fine on newer versions too.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   Save the main code as `finn_dashboard.py` in your preferred directory.

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn
   ```
   
   If you run into any dependency issues, try:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install streamlit==1.28.1 pandas==2.0.3 numpy==1.24.3 plotly==5.15.0 scikit-learn==1.3.0
   ```

3. **Launch the dashboard**
   ```bash
   streamlit run finn_dashboard.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:8501`. If not, navigate there manually.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Streamlit not recognized"**: Make sure you've activated the correct Python environment and installed streamlit properly.

**Module import errors**: Double-check all dependencies are installed. Sometimes `pip install -r requirements.txt` works better if you create a requirements file.

**Port already in use**: Try `streamlit run finn_dashboard.py --server.port 8502` to use a different port.
